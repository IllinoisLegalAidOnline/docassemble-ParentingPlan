  Parenting Plan
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **${form_name}** Easy Form.

  This program helps you make forms that provide financial information and documents to the other party in family law cases.
  
  If you are in a court case for divorce, child support, or temporary maintenance, you and the other person will probably have to share information about your income, property, and expenses.

  About the *Parenting Plan*
subquestion: |
  The *${form_name}* is a very long form.




  A Parenting Plan contains information about who will make decisions for the children and a schedule for when the children are with each parent.
  
  If you have completed the Parenting Plan by the time you are ready to file your case, you can file it with your petition (example: divorce, parental responsibilities, etc.).
  
  If not, you must file it within 120 days of the date you file your petition.
