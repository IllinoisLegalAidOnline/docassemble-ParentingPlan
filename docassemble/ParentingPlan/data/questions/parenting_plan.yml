  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **${form_name}** Easy Form.

  This program helps you make forms that provide financial information and documents to the other party in family law cases.
  
  If you are in a court case for divorce, child support, or temporary maintenance, you and the other person will probably have to share information about your income, property, and expenses.

  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To complete this program, you will need to know:

  * How you want to split parental responsibilities? (formerly custody)

  * How you want to split parenting time? (formerly visitation)

  * Information about your family law court case (examples: divorce, parentage, etc.).

  If this is a new case, you will need to know where you will file.

  It could take 30 minutes to 60 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later.

  About the *${form_name}*
subquestion: |
  The *${form_name}* is a very long form.

  A *${form_name}* contains information about who will make decisions for the children and a schedule for when the children are with each parent.
  
  If you have completed the *${form_name}* by the time you are ready to file your case, you can file it with your petition (example: divorce, parental responsibilities, etc.).
  
  If not, you must file it within 120 days of the date you file your petition.
